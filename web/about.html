<body class="page-template-default"><main><h1>About</h1><p>Golden Triangle Software is sort of a fake company. I came up with the name when I was learning coding and web development and living in the Golden Triangle area in Mississippi. I was trying to get into freelance work and had the ambitious notion of going around to all of the doctor&#8217;s offices in the area, handing them a business card, and convincing them that they all needed new websites. That never really panned out, but I have continued to use this space as a kind of catch-all for personal projects undertaken for the purposes of learning, as well as websites (some of which are no longer online) designed and built for friends and local acquaintances. This space and the goofy fake company name are still useful to me, as I would rather not have my full name associated solely with my trade on the internet, and the projects are kind of interesting to me as historical markers. I&#8217;m not a designer, but I designed everything here, and I think some of the projects are interesting looking. The site itself has had some work done under the hood since it first launched. As of the latest rebuild, it&#8217;s running as a headless CMS setup, with WordPress serving as the back end and 11ty generating a static site for the front end.</p>
